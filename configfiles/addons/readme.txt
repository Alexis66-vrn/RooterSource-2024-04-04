Flashing ROOter
-----------------------

When flashing from the factory firmware use the image with "factory"
in its name if one exists. Otherwise use the one with "upgrade"
in its name.

When upgrading ROOter to a new version use the image with "upgrade"
in its name only.

Images with "full" in their name will have Load Balancing included.
Those without do not have Load Balancing.
